Welcome to the Segp Group T project Backend README!

## Backend Setup
To run the backend, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
   - Run the following command to install dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Run the Server**:
   - Once the dependencies are installed, run the `server.py` file. You can do this by executing the following command:
     ```
     python server.py
     ```

3. **Check Port Availability**:
   - Ensure that port 3001 is not being used by any other software on your system. If it is occupied, either terminate the process using that port or modify the backend code to use a different port.

4. **Access the Backend**:
   - After starting the server successfully, you can access the backend APIs using the appropriate endpoints. These endpoints will be defined in the `server.py` file or in the routes/controllers directory.
